> This is an UBC CPSC 210 project
 
### *TODO* list:

- [x] ~~Citation Template~~
    - [x] ~~MLA~~
    - [x] ~~APA~~
- [x] ~~User Input(CUI)~~
- [x] ~~Citation Selector~~

- [x] ~~Change CommandLineUI so that it uses FullCitation instead of maintaining its own TreeSet.~~
- [x] ~~Address the bug where two consecutive MLA citation of the same authors was not simplified in to "â€”"
  in the author section~~
- [x] ~~change MlaTitle such that MINOR or MAJOR work is defined as a mode constant instead of stored as a boolean.~~
- [ ] Switch Gradle/Maven for more compatible compilation and running.
